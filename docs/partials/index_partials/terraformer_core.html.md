> Tools and objects for working with and transforming GeoJSON.

The core Terraformer library provides a series of `Terraformer.Primitives` which wrap GeoJSON objects for additional functionality and a series of `Terraformer.Tools` for manipulating and performing calculations on coordinates.

You can also use the core library to see if an object contains or intersects another object, convert an object to a different spatial reference, or transform an object's coordinates.

The core library is also used in most other components of Terraformer for performing basic tasks and calculations.
